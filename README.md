# Minecraft-Function-Generator
a minecraft function generator

### Why use MFG?
In minecraft, it's very complicated to use mcfunction to perform four operations or other operations. In order to simplify the cost of mcfunction without reducing the flexibility of the language, MFG was born.

### Develop
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Bdbmzwsc/minecraftFunctionGenerator
$ cd minecraftFunctionGenerator
$ touch build
$ cmake ..
$ cd build
$ make
$ ./build_test
```

Enjoy!
